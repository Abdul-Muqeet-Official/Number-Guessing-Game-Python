Number Guessing Game in Python ðŸŽ®
Description
This project is a simple Python-based number guessing game. The computer generates a random number between 0 and 10, and the user tries to guess it within a given number of turns. With each guess, the program provides hints if the guess is too low or too high, making it easier to get closer to the correct answer.

How It Works
The computer generates a random number between 0 and 10.
The user inputs how many turns they would like to guess the number.
The user enters their guess.
The program provides feedback:
If the guess is correct, the user wins.
If the guess is too high or too low, the user can guess again until the turn limit is reached.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of turns.
Features
Uses Python's random library to generate a random number.
Allows user to set a number of attempts (turns).
Provides feedback for each guess (whether it's too high, too low, or correct).
Simple and minimal code structure, making it beginner-friendly.
